    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sizzling Crispy Sisig is a great dish to prepare during Christmas dinner or in any special occasion. It has a nice texture and the flavor is out-of-this-world. I enjoy having it for dinner with a cup of white rice. It can also be served as an appetizer along with a cold bottle or glass of your favorite drink.</p>
